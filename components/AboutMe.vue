    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I’m Sophia, a front‑end developer and UI/UX designer from the
      amazing city of Leiden in the Netherlands. Currently studying Computer
      Science, I’m passionate about developing beautiful, intuitive interfaces
      that make people’s lives easier and more enjoyable. You’ll often find me
      breaking a sweat—whether it’s hitting the gym, going for a run,
      bouldering, crossfitting or trying out a new sport. I’m also an avid
      nature lover, and my favorite vacations are spent hiking the mountain
      trails, soaking in breathtaking views and fresh alpine air.
      <br />
      <br />
      I’m deeply inspired by the process that comes before programming
      interfaces. Reaching out to users, observing how they interact, and
      uncovering the core of their challenges. I believe this is the most
      essential and often the most overlooked part of creating a great app or
      website. By truly understanding the problem, you can design something
      that’s not only functional and visually appealing, but also genuinely
      meaningful and enjoyable for the people who use it.
