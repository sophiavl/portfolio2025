    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I’m Sophia van Lieshout, a front‑end developer and UI/UX designer
      from the charming city of Leiden in the Netherlands. Currently studying
      Computer Science, I’m passionate about crafting beautiful, intuitive
      interfaces that make people’s lives easier and more enjoyable. When I’m
      not coding or sketching out wireframes, you’ll find me breaking a
      sweat—whether it’s hitting the gym, going for a run, bouldering,
      crossfitting or trying out a new sport. I’m also an avid nature lover, and
      my favorite vacations are spent hiking the mountain trails, soaking in
      breathtaking views and fresh alpine air. I thrive on projects that have
      real impact—whether it’s streamlining a daily task, improving
      accessibility, or bringing people closer through engaging design. If
      you’re looking for someone who blends technical expertise with creative
      problem‑solving (and a healthy dose of outdoor wanderlust), let’s connect
      and build something meaningful together!
