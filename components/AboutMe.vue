          Hello! I’m Sophia, a front‑end developer and UI/UX designer from the
          amazing city of Leiden in the Netherlands. Currently studying Computer
          Science, I’m passionate about developing beautiful, intuitive
          interfaces that make people’s lives easier and more enjoyable. You’ll
          often find me breaking a sweat—whether it’s hitting the gym, going for
          a run, bouldering, crossfitting or trying out a new sport. I’m also an
          avid nature lover, and my favorite vacations are spent hiking the
          mountain trails, soaking in breathtaking views and fresh alpine air.

          I’m deeply inspired by the process that comes before programming
          interfaces. Reaching out to users, observing how they interact, and
          uncovering the core of their challenges. I believe this is the most
          essential and often the most overlooked part of creating a great app
          or website. By truly understanding the problem, you can design
          something that’s not only functional and visually appealing, but also
          genuinely meaningful and enjoyable for the people who use it.
